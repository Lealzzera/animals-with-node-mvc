# Animals nodejs with MVC

This is a project made with nodejs, express and mustache using MVC pattern, I've made this project to train my skills and learn how it works, it's a really interesting way to create a web application just using backend technology, without a front-end framework such as, Reactjs, Vuejs or Angular. I hope you enjoy.

### Global requirements:

`npm i -g nodemon typescript ts-node`

### Install

`npm install`

### Command to run

`npm run start-dev`
